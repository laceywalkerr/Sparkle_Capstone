### MVP Requirements
Users can log in, post, edit and delete a post. Users can also rate how they feel about the product (1-5 stars), and search for products they would like to read up on. Users can upload photos of a product. Users can tag a category to their review,  ie: type of product, or by color.

### Stretch Goals
Other stretch goals include posting a link to the product, as well as possibly using an API. Users can upload their own profile images. Users also have access to a search by category button and comment on reviews.  Full crud on categories. Users will have a views counter and likes on their review. Users cannot repetitively like a post.
